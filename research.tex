\section{Problem Description}
Suppose you wish to create a recording of yourself as you move around and do activities. Usually, you have a middle man that is between you and your camera so that the they can control the camera so that it is continuously focused on you. However, it is not always the case that this cameraman is available to help you film yourself.

\section{Problem Solution}
To eliminate the need for a cameraman, a camera is first placed on a custom mount. Then from reading the inputstream of the camera, software we track your motion displacement and control the mount to follow your motions. The mount is capable of rotating along a horizontal plane and a vertical plane.

\section{Existing Solution}
\subsection{SoloShot}
First solution
Designed for surfers to record practice runs
works outdoor, waterproof
built on Xigbee wireless communication and GPS
uses marker armband so does not need to maintain line of sight
does NOT work indoors or close range
SoloShot2 adds tilting, zooming, start/stop button

\subsection{Swivl}
Does pan and tilt using marker to sense what to follow
requires line of sight

\subsection{AlMe}
